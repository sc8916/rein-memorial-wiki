A Memorial to my friend Rein in the style of Wikipedia

## setup
HTML is autogenerated from the markdown to make it easier for everyone to edit and make changes

I use github actions that calls `format_html.py` on `template.html` and `text.md`
To make the action able to change `index.html`, I use a deploy key that I then add as an Action secret so GH actions can access it.
